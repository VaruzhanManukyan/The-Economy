                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">What Is a Market Economy?</h1>
                <p>
                    A market economy is an economic system in which economic decisions and the pricing of goods and
                    services are guided by the interactions of a country's individual citizens and businesses. There may
                    be some government intervention or central planning, but usually this term refers to an economy that
                    is more market oriented in general.
                </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">
                        In a market economy, most economic decision making is done through voluntary transactions
                        according to the laws of supply and demand.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">
                        A market economy gives entrepreneurs the freedom to pursue profit by creating outputs that are
                        more valuable than the inputs they use up, and free to fail and go out of business if they do
                        not.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">
                        Economists broadly agree that market-oriented economies produce better economic outcomes, but
                        differ on the precise balance between markets and central planning that is best for a nation's
                        long-term wellbeing.

                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Understanding Market Economies</h1>
                <p>
                    The theoretical basis for market economies was developed by classical economists, such as Adam
                    Smith, David Ricardo, and Jean-Baptiste Say. These classically liberal free market advocates
                    believed that the “invisible hand” of the profit motive and market incentives generally guided
                    economic decisions down more productive and efficient paths than government planning of the economy.
                    They believed that government intervention often tended to lead to economic inefficiencies that
                    actually made people worse off.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Market Theory</h1>
                <p>
                    Market economies work using the forces of supply and demand to determine the appropriate prices and
                    quantities for most goods and services in the economy. Entrepreneurs marshal factors of production
                    (land, labor, and capital) and combine them in cooperation with workers and financial backers, to
                    produce goods and services for consumers or other businesses to buy. Buyers and sellers agree on the
                    terms of these transactions voluntarily based on consumers preferences for various goods and the
                    revenues that businesses want to earn on their investments. The allocation of resources by
                    entrepreneurs across different businesses and production processes is determined by the profits they
                    hope to make by producing output that their customers will value beyond what the entrepreneurs paid
                    for the inputs. Entrepreneurs that successfully do so are rewarded with profits that they can
                    reinvest in future business, and those who fail to do so either learn to improve over time or go out
                    of business.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Modern Market Economies</h1>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    Every economy in the modern world falls somewhere along a continuum running from pure market to
                    fully planned. Most developed nations are technically mixed economies because they blend free
                    markets with some government interference. However, they are often said to have market economies
                    because they allow market forces to drive the vast majority of activities, typically engaging in
                    government intervention only to the extent it is needed to provide stability.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    Market economies may still engage in some government interventions, such as price-fixing, licensing,
                    quotas, and industrial subsidies. Most commonly, market economies feature government production of
                    public goods, often as a government monopoly. But overall, market economies are characterized by
                    decentralized economic decision making by buyers and sellers transacting everyday business. In
                    particular, market economies can be distinguished by having functional markets for corporate
                    control, which allow for the transfer and reorganization of the economic means of production among
                    entrepreneurs.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    Although the market economy is clearly the popular system of choice, there is significant debate
                    regarding the amount of government intervention considered optimal for efficient economic
                    operations. Economists mostly believe that more market oriented economies will be rather successful
                    at generating wealth, economic growth, and rising living standards, but often differ on the precise
                    scope, scale, and specific roles for government intervention that are necessarily to provide the
                    fundamental legal and institutional framework that markets might need in order to function well.
