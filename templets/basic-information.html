                <p>
                    The subject of the study of economics is the regularities that arise between the participants in the
                    economic system in the process of their economic activity. Economic analysis is carried out at one
                    of three levels: microeconomic, macroeconomic and global.Microeconomics studies economic activity
                    within a single enterprise, industry or local market.
                    Macroeconomics covers the market of any state or region. The world economy studies the influence of
                    national markets on each other, as well as the pace and trends in the development of economic
                    activity on a global scale.

                <p>
                    In economic analysis, in order to obtain the most accurate conclusions, many factors must be taken
                    into account, the degree of influence of each of which cannot be precisely determined. That is why
                    economics is not an exact science. On the other hand, it cannot be called completely humanitarian
                    either, since mathematical calculations are used in the construction of economic models. The
                    structural elements of the economy that are subject to analysis are.

                    The fundamental concepts of economics are supply and demand. Demand means the willingness of a
                    certain number of consumers to purchase a particular product or service at a specified cost. First
                    of all, it depends, of course, on the price. However, a number of other factors can also have a
                    significant impact on the volume of demand. These factors are.

                    The offer, in turn, shows the volume of goods that, depending on a particular market price,
                    entrepreneurs are ready to produce.
                    Supply and demand graphs are curves whose intersection point means the equilibrium price, that is,
                    the market value of a good or service that satisfies both consumers and sellers.

                        The main stimulus for the development of market relations is competition. Thanks to it,
                        consumers
                        get the opportunity to choose the necessary product at the price that suits them. The absence of
                        a
                        healthy competitive environment can lead to the emergence of oligopolies and monopolies that
                        have an
                        advantageous position in front of buyers, thanks to which they can dictate their terms.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">
                        Practice shows that competition is not always formed and develops in a natural way. Sooner or
                        later,
                        there may be collusion between manufacturers or sellers, because of which consumers will have to
                        overpay for some products or services, which may also be of inadequate quality. In this regard,
                        in
                        some cases, it is necessary for the regulator to intervene in certain economic processes. As a
                        rule,
                        the state acts as such a regulator.

                        The degree of influence of state bodies on the domestic economy can be different. If there is a
                        significant influence on economic activity within the country by the government, then such an
                        economy is called a command-administrative economy. If the impact is insignificant, then the
                        economy
                        is considered mixed. In its pure form, a market economy within the state is not currently found.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">
                        There is also a traditional economy based on subsistence and customs. This type of economic
                        activity
                        is typical for various tribes that have survived to this day and live apart.
