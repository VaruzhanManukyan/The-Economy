                <p>
                    Economics is a social science that focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods
                    and services, and analyzes the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make
                    to allocate resources.

                        Economics is the study of how people allocate scarce resources for production, distribution, and
                        consumption, both individually and collectively.

                        Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are widely used economic

                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Understanding Economics</h1>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    Assuming humans have unlimited wants within a world of limited means, economists analyze how
                    resources are allocated for production, distribution, and consumption.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    The study of microeconomics focuses on the choices of individuals and businesses, and macroeconomics
                    concentrates on the behavior of the economy as a whole, on an aggregate level.
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    One of the earliest recorded economists was the 8th-century B.C. Greek farmer and poet Hesiod who
                    wrote that labor, materials, and time needed to be allocated efficiently to overcome scarcity. The
                    publication of Adam Smith's 1776 book, An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
                    Nations sparked the beginning of the current Western contemporary economic theories.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Microeconomics</h1>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    Microeconomics studies how individual consumers and firms make decisions to allocate resources.
                    Whether a single person, a household, or a business, economists may analyze how these entities
                    respond to changes in price and why they demand what they do at particular price levels.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    Microeconomics analyzes how and why goods are valued differently, how individuals make financial
                    decisions, and how they trade, coordinate, and cooperate.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    Within the dynamics of supply and demand, the costs of producing goods and services, and how labor
                    is divided and allocated, microeconomics studies how businesses are organized and how individuals
                    approach uncertainty and risk in their decision-making.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Microeconomics</h1>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an
                    economy as a whole. Its primary focus is the recurrent economic cycles and broad economic growth
                    and development.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    It focuses on foreign trade, government fiscal and monetary policy, unemployment rates, the
                    level of inflation, interest rates, the growth of total production output, and business cycles
                    that result in expansions, booms, recessions, and depressions.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    Using aggregate indicators, economists use macroeconomic models to help formulate economic
                    policies and strategies.

                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">What Is the Role of an Economist?</h1>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    An economist studies the relationship between a society's resources and its production or output,
                    and their opinions help shape economic policies related to interest rates, tax laws, employment
                    programs, international trade agreements, and corporate strategies.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    Economists analyze economic indicators, such as gross domestic product and the consumer price index
                    to identify potential trends or make economic forecasts.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 36% of all economists in the United States work for a
                    federal or state agency. Economists are also employed as professors, by corporations, or as part of
                    economic think tanks.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">What Are Economic Indicators?</h1>
                <p>
                    Economic indicators detail a country's economic performance. Published periodically by governmental
                    agencies or private organizations, economic indicators often have a considerable effect on stocks,
                    employment, and international markets, and often predict future economic conditions that will move
                    markets and guide investment decisions.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Retail sales</h1>
                <p>
                    Reported by the Department of Commerce (DOC) during the middle of each month, the retail sales
                    report is very closely watched and measures the total receipts, or dollar value, of all merchandise
                    sold in stores.
                    Sampling retailers across the country acts as a proxy of consumer spending levels. Consumer spending
                    represents more than two-thirds of GDP, proving useful to gauge the economy's general direction.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Industrial production</h1>
                <p>
                    The industrial production report, released monthly by the Federal Reserve, reports changes in the
                    production of factories, mines, and utilities in the U.S. One measure included in this report is the
                    capacity utilization ratio, which estimates the portion of productive capacity that is being used
                    rather than standing idle in the economy.
                    Capacity utilization in the range of 82% to 85% is considered "tight" and can increase the
                    likelihood of price increases or supply shortages in the near term. Levels below 80% are interpreted
                    as showing "slack" in the economy, which may increase the likelihood of a recession.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Employment Data</h1>
                <p>
                    The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases employment data in a report called the nonfarm
                    payrolls on the first Friday of each month.
                    Sharp increases in employment indicate prosperous economic growth and potential contractions may be
                    imminent if significant decreases occur. These are generalizations and it is important to consider
                    the current position of the economy.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Consumer Price Index (CPI)</h1>
                <p>
                    The Consumer Price Index (CPI), also issued by the BLS, measures the level of retail price changes,
                    and the costs that consumers pay, and is the benchmark for measuring inflation. Using a basket that
                    is representative of the goods and services in the economy, the CPI compares the price changes month
                    after month and year after year.
                    This report is an important economic indicator and its release can increase volatility in equity,
                    fixed income, and forex markets. Greater-than-expected price increases are considered a sign of
                    inflation, which will likely cause the underlying currency to depreciate.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Economic Systems</h1>
                <p>
                    Five economic systems illustrate historical practices used to allocate resources to meet the needs
                    of the individual and society.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Primitivism</h1>
                <p>
                    In primitive agrarian societies, individuals produced necessities from building dwellings, growing
                    crops, and hunting game at the household or tribal level.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Feudalism</h1>
                <p>
                    A political and economic system of Europe from the 9th to 15th century, feudalism was defined by the
                    lords who held land and leased it to peasants for production, who received a promise of safety and
                    security from the lord.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Capitalism</h1>
                <p>
                    With the advent of the industrial revolution, capitalism emerged and is defined as a system of
                    production where business owners organize resources including tools, workers, and raw materials to
                    produce goods for market consumption and earn profits. Supply and demand set prices in markets in a
                    way that can serve the best interests of society.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Socialism</h1>
                <p>
                    Socialism is a form of a cooperative production economy. Economic socialism is a system of
                    production where there is limited or hybrid private ownership of the means of production. Prices,
                    profits, and losses are not the determining factors used to establish who engages in the production,
                    what to produce and how to produce it.
                </p>
                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Communism</h1>
                <p>
                    Communism holds that all economic activity is centralized through the coordination of
                    state-sponsored central planners with common ownership of production and distribution.

                <h1 class="header-main-secondary">Schools of Economic Theory?</h1>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    Many economic theories have evolved as societies and markets have grown and changed. However, three
                    disciplines of economics, neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian, have influenced modern society.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    The principles of neoclassical economics are often used as a framework to illustrate the virtues of
                    capitalism, including the tendency of market prices to reach equilibrium as the volume of supply and
                    demand changes. The optimal valuation of resources emerges from the forces of individual desire and
                    scarcity.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
                    John Maynard Keynes developed the theory of Keynesian economics during the Great Depression. Arguing
                    against neoclassical theory, Keynes showed that the restrained markets and government intervention
                    in markets create a stable and equitable economic system and advocated for a monetary policy

                    Marxian economics is defined in Karl Marx's work Das Kapital. Marxian economics is a rejection of
                    the classical view of economics arguing against the idea that the free market, an economic system
                    determined by supply and demand with little or no government control, benefits society. He espoused
                    that capitalism only benefits a select few and that the ruling class becomes richer by extracting
                    value out of cheap labor provided by the working class.

                <p>
                    A command economy is an economy in which production, investment, prices, and incomes are determined
                    centrally by a government. A communist society has a command economy.

                <p>
                    Behavioral economics combines psychology, judgment, decision-making, and economics to understand
                    human behavior.
