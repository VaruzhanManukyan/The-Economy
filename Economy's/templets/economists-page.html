                            Adam Smith is a towering figure in the history of economic thought. Known primarily for
                            a
                            single
                            work—An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), the first
                            comprehensive system of political economy—he is more properly regarded as a social
                            philosopher
                            whose economic writings constitute only the capstone to an overarching view of political
                            and
                            social evolution. If his masterwork is viewed in relation to his earlier lectures on
                            moral
                            philosophy and government, as well as to allusions in The Theory of Moral Sentiments
                            (1759)
                            to a
                            work he hoped to write on “the general principles of law and government, and of the
                            different
                            revolutions they have undergone in the different ages and periods of society,” then The
                            Wealth
                            of Nations may be seen not merely as a treatise on economics but also as a partial
                            exposition of
                            a much larger scheme of historical evolution.Much more is known about Adam Smith’s
                            thought than about his life. He was the son by second marriage of Adam Smith,
                            comptroller of customs at Kirkcaldy, a small (population 1,500) but thriving fishing
                            village near Edinburgh, and Margaret Douglas, daughter of a substantial landowner. Of
                            Smith’s childhood nothing is known other than that he received his elementary schooling
                            in Kirkcaldy and that at the age of four years he was said to have been carried off by
                            gypsies. Pursuit was mounted, and young Adam was abandoned by his captors. “He would
                            have made, I fear, a poor gipsy,” commented the Scottish journalist John Rae
                            (1845–1915), Smith’s principal biographer.

                            Karl Marx, in full Karl Heinrich Marx, (born May 5, 1818, Trier, Rhine province, Prussia
                            [Germany]—died March 14, 1883, London, England), revolutionary, sociologist, historian,
                            and economist. He published (with Friedrich Engels) Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei
                            (1848), commonly known as The Communist Manifesto, the most celebrated pamphlet in the
                            history of the socialist movement. He also was the author of the movement’s most
                            important book, Das Kapital. These writings and others by Marx and Engels form the basis
                            of the body of thought and belief known as Marxism. (See also socialism; communism.)
                            Karl Heinrich Marx was the oldest surviving boy of nine children. His father, Heinrich,
                            a successful lawyer, was a man of the Enlightenment, devoted to Kant and Voltaire, who
                            took part in agitations for a constitution in Prussia. His mother, born Henrietta
                            Pressburg, was from Holland. Both parents were Jewish and were descended from a long
                            line of rabbis, but, a year or so before Karl was born, his father—probably because his
                            professional career required it—was baptized in the Evangelical Established Church. Karl
                            was baptized when he was six years old.

                                John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946) was an early 20th-century British economist, best known
                                as
                                the founder of Keynesian economics and the father of modern macroeconomics, the study of
                                how
                                economies—markets and other systems that operate on a large scale—behave. One of the
                                hallmarks of Keynesian economics is that governments should actively try to influence
                                the
                                course of economies, especially by increasing spending to stimulate demand in the face
                                of
                                recession.
                                In his seminal work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money—considered
                                one of
                                the most influential economics books in history—he advocates government intervention as
                                a
                                solution to high unemployment.Keynes was born into a moderately prosperous family. His
                                father, John Neville Keynes, was an economist and later an academic administrator at
                                King’s College, Cambridge. His mother was one of the first female graduates of the same
                                university, which he entered in 1902.

                                At Cambridge he was influenced by economist Alfred Marshall, who prompted Keynes to
                                shift his academic interests from mathematics and the classics to politics and
                                economics. Cambridge also introduced Keynes to an important group of writers and
                                artists. The early history of the Bloomsbury group—an exclusive circle of the cultural
                                elect, which counted among its members Leonard and Virginia Woolf, the painter Duncan
                                Grant, and the art critic Clive Bell—centred upon Cambridge and the remarkable figure of
                                Lytton Strachey. Strachey, who had entered Cambridge two years before Keynes, inducted
                                the younger man into the exclusive private club known simply as “the Society.” Its
                                members and associates (some of them homosexual, like Keynes himself) were the leading
                                spirits of Bloomsbury. Throughout his life Keynes was to cherish the affection and
                                respond to the influence of this group.</p>

                                David Ricardo (1772–1823) was a classical economist best known for his theory on wages
                                and
                                profit, the labor theory of value, the theory of comparative advantage, and the theory
                                of
                                rents. David Ricardo and several other economists also simultaneously and independently
                                discovered the law of diminishing marginal returns. His most well-known work is
                                Principles
                                of Political Economy and Taxation (1817).
                                Born in England in 1772, one of 17 children, David Ricardo began working with his father
                                as
                                a stockbroker at the age of 14. He was disowned by his father at 21, however, for
                                marrying
                                outside his religion. His wealth came from his success with a business he started that
                                dealt
                                with government securities. He retired at the age of 41 after earning an estimated £1
                                million speculating on the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo.
                                Ricardo was the third son born to a family of Sephardic Jews who had emigrated from the
                                Netherlands to England. At the age of 14 he entered into business with his father, who
                                had made a fortune on the London Stock Exchange. By the time he was 21, however, he had
                                broken with his father over religion, become a Unitarian, and married a Quaker. He
                                continued as a member of the stock exchange, where his talents and character won him the
                                support of an eminent banking house. He did so well that in a few years he acquired a
                                fortune, which allowed him to pursue interests in literature and science, particularly
                                in the fields of mathematics, chemistry, and geology.

                                John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) was born in London, the eldest son of James Mill, a leading
                                disciple and friend of Jeremy Bentham. In his Autobiography (1873) the younger Mill
                                described the remarkable education he received from his father, beginning Greek at the
                                age
                                of three and Latin at eight. At 15, massively instructed in a wide range of subjects,
                                including economics, history, philosophy, and even some branches of natural science, he
                                first read Bentham and emerged with a unifying conception of things and a sense of
                                purpose
                                in life. In 1823 he followed his father into the service of the East India Company and
                                remained with the company until he retired in 1858.
                                The eldest son of the British historian, economist, and philosopher James Mill, he was
                                born in his father’s house in Pentonville, London. He was educated exclusively by his
                                father, who was a strict disciplinarian. By his eighth year he had read in the original
                                Greek Aesop’s Fables, Xenophon’s Anabasis, and the whole of the historian Herodotus. He
                                was acquainted with the satirist Lucian, the historian of philosophy Diogenes Laërtius,
                                the Athenian writer and educational theorist Isocrates, and six dialogues of Plato. He
                                had also read a great deal of history in English. At the age of eight he started Latin,
                                the geometry of Euclid, and algebra and began to teach the younger children of the
                                family. His main reading was still history, but he went through all the Latin and Greek
                                authors commonly read in the schools and universities and, by the age of 10 could read
                                Plato and the Athenian statesman Demosthenes with ease. About the age of 12, he began a
                                thorough study of Scholastic logic, at the same time reading Aristotle’s logical
                                treatises in the original. In the following year he was introduced to political economy
                                and studied the work of the Scottish political economist and philosopher Adam Smith and
                                that of the English economist David Ricardo.

                                Irving Fisher was one of America’s greatest mathematical economists and one of the
                                clearest economics writers of all time. He had the intellect to use mathematics in
                                virtually all his theories and the good sense to introduce it only after he had clearly
                                explained the central principles in words. And he explained very well. Fisher’s Theory
                                of Interest is written so clearly that graduate economics students can read—and
                                understand—half the book in one sitting, something unheard of in technical economics.
                                Although he damaged his reputation by insisting throughout the Great Depression that
                                recovery was imminent, contemporary economic models of interest and capital are based on
                                Fisherian principles. Similarly, monetarism is founded on Fisher’s principles of money
                                and prices.
                                Fisher’s crusading spirit led him to embrace many reformist causes, including health,
                                eugenics, conservation, prohibition, and the League of Nations. He also proved himself
                                an able businessman, earning a fortune in 1910 by marketing a card-index file system he
                                had devised. Moreover, in 1926 he was one of the founders of Remington Rand, Inc., and
                                he served on its board of directors until his death.

                                From the 1950s through the 1970s, John Kenneth Galbraith was one of the most widely read
                                economists in the United States. One reason is that he wrote so well, with the ability
                                to turn a clever phrase that made those he argued against look foolish. Galbraith’s
                                first major book, published in 1952, is American Capitalism: The Concept of
                                Countervailing Power. In it he argued that giant firms had replaced small ones to the
                                point where the perfectly competitive model no longer applied to much of the American
                                economy. But not to worry, he added. The power of large firms was offset by the
                                countervailing power of large unions, so that consumers were protected by competing
                                centers of power.
                                Galbraith’s major works included American Capitalism: The Concept of Countervailing
                                Power (1951), in which he questioned the competitive ideal in industrial organization.
                                In his popular critique of the wealth gap, The Affluent Society (1958), Galbraith
                                faulted the “conventional wisdom” of American economic policies and called for less
                                spending on consumer goods and more spending on government programs. In The New
                                Industrial State (1967) he envisioned a growing similarity between “managerial”
                                capitalism and socialism and called for intellectual and political changes to stem what
                                he saw as a decline of competitiveness in the American economy. Among his many other
                                works were The Great Crash, 1929 (1955), The Liberal Hour (1960), Ambassador’s Journal
                                (1969), A Life in Our Times: Memoirs (1981), The Anatomy of Power (1983), Economics in
                                Perspective: A Critical History (1987), and The Culture of Contentment (1992). He was
                                awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1946 and 2000. See also John Kenneth
